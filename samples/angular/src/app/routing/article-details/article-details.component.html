            <p class="normal-text">Airline jobs are just that. They are employment opportunities for people with satisfactory flying skills that are
            transferrable to other airlines worldwide. Airlines do not teach people to fly, they convert licensed pilots to specific
            aircraft then help them maintain those skills. Once you join an airline, career development and resilience are your
            responsibilities.</p>
